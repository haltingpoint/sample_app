# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application (I renamed to "Chapter3SampleApp")

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

The tutorial calls it "sample application" but I wasn't sure if it was just for this chapter or for the rest of the book so renamed it to "Chapter3SampleApp" instead. Hope that's alright...
